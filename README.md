# ELM-APIs
A repository for IBM ELM API tools and Demonstration code


I have been blogging about how to use IBM's Engineering Lifecycle Management APIs over at [Day Job Blog](https://michaelrowe01.com/index.php/category/day-job/ibm-elm/).

As part of that effort I have created a few postman example files to address using both OIDC and OAuth1.0a security.  You can find those posts at:

- [Oauth1.0a](https://michaelrowe01.com/index.php/day-job/ibm-elm/api-authentication-method-in-elm-oauth-1-0a/)
- [OIDC](https://michaelrowe01.com/index.php/day-job/ibm-elm/api-authentication-method-in-elm-oidc/)
